### OlÃ¡! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github page! My name is Mateus Maia, and I am a Ph.D. student at Maynooth University (Ireland) under the supervision of Professor Andrew Parnell and co-supervision of Professor Keefe Murphy. My ongoing thesis focuses on developing extensions to Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART).

Before this, I completed my Master's degree in Statistics at the Federal University of Bahia (Brazil), where I worked under the guidance of Professor Anderson Ara. During my master's program, I built novel ensemble settings and developed a model called "Random Machines" that used a novel ensemble technique utilizing Support Vector Machines as base learners. This approach achieved a great predictive capacity in my experiments. I also hold a Bsc. degree in Geophysics by the Federal University of Bahia (Brazil).

My current research interests include tree-based models, statistical learning, Bayesian statistical learning, and ensemble models. I have advanced knowledge of R programming and a good understanding of C++, Python, Julia, and LaTeX.

This Github page will host some of my works, including my research, codes, and projects. I hope this page will help others interested in machine learning and statistical modeling, and I am always open to collaborate or discuss new ideas. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.
